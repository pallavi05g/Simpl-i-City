# Simpl-i-City
Simpl-i-city is a one-stop solution for any newbie in a city (food, local lingo, places to see, clubs, stay etc). This prototype aims to eliminate the hurdles faced with respect to local food, language, places to explore, clubs, places to stay. This prototype was developed as a part of the Human Computer Interaction MOOC by Scott Klemmer.
